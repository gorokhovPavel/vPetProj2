# Vue Instance

This demonstrates creating the core Vue instance, which is another sort of
hello world but for the framework. Think of this as the minimum Vue app or
starting point. Assigning variables to the core instance happens by reference,
so then updating the core instance updates the variables.

Furthermore, callback methods can be inserted into the Vue Core app flow below.
